pushing docker images to local registry
    1. pull image
    2. docker tag <imageID> localhost:5000/<imageName>:<taggedVersion>
    3.docker push localhost:5000/<imageName>:<taggedVersion>


NOTE, change kebab demo to:
      repository: localhost:5000/kebab-demo
      tag: 1.22.0-alpha-25351

      
Local docker registry catalog:
    http://localhost:5000/v2/_catalog



Deployments do not create pods (something to do with how the helmChart is configured), use below to create the pods:
    kubectl scale deployments -n stg demo-kebab --replicas 1





Access to cluster services using "kubectl proxy":
    http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/services/http:<service-name>:80/proxy/
    http://127.0.0.1:8001/api/v1/namespaces/devops/services/http:devops-docs:80/proxy/




TODO:
    not sure if ingress is working, could be just the hostnames
    auto generated sealed secret for sealed secret controller
    condo build to local docker registry to deployment in the cluster
    do we want to make the docker registry images persistent?
    mongo DB docker container attached to the kind network (or does it make more sense to have it as a pod in the cluster under a different namespace??)
